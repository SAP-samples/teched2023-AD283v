1. In which exercise did the problem occur?



2. Did you follow *all* instructions since the last time it still worked? (Please re-check whether you missed something, as this could cause an inconsistent state. Also remember that JavaScript is case-sensitive and commas and braces need to be set correctly.)



3. What *exactly* is the problem? (Please describe as completely as possible, giving us enough context to work with.)



4. If applicable, especially if the UI5 application does not run successfully: are there any errors in the browser's developer console? (Press `F12` to open, switch to the "Console" if needed. Paste the content here in case of errors.)



5. If anything suggests that a file contains a syntax error: please re-check your edits to this file and paste its content below.



6. Is there any other useful information? (Attach a screenshot if it helps explaining the issue and mention any uncommon OS/browser you may be using.)
